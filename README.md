# randomquotes
A Random Quotes Generator.

Pulls a random quote from a book on the Manchester Guardian's list of *[1000 Novels Everyone Must Read.](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jan/23/bestbooks-fiction)*

Quotes supplied by the [LibraryThing Web Services API](http://www.librarything.com/services/rest/documentation/1.1/).

This is partly a front-end development exercise, and also (by chance) an opportunity to learn XML DOM traversal.
LibraryThing is a great resource for book information, but the API that returns quotes currently only does so in XML format.
(GoodReads does not have an API for accessing quotes.)
